The dashboard features a drop-down menu located at the top, which allows users to select the number of cylinders. Additionally, an Origin Selector is provided on the right side, which enables users to select the countries of origin for the cars being analyzed. The dashboard then displays the average weight of the cars in the selected origin.</p>

<p>To further facilitate the analysis, the dashboard includes a bar graph that illustrates the horsepower to cylinder ratio for the cars. A scatter plot is also provided to display the horsepower to acceleration ratio of the cars. Furthermore, a pie chart is utilized to depict the miles per gallon of the cars. To conclude the analysis, a final bar graph is presented, which illustrates the distribution of cars versus the number of cylinders.</p>
