<p> Car data analysis dashboard. On the top a dropdown is shown through which you can select the number of cylinders. And on the right side we have origin selector through which we can select various origin countries of the car. Then shows the average weight of the car in that origin. Then a horsepower to cylinder ratio is shown in a bar graph. Then horsepower to acceleration ratio of the car is shown in the scatter plot. The pie chart shows the Mile per Gallon of the cars. The next bar graph shows the car vs the number of cylinders distribution.</p>
